# Dropzone Indicator

This plugin will add some CSS to each page that visualizes dropzones during
widget's drag&drop times, to indicate where they can be dropped. This way even
empty columns can be easily identified as drop targets.

It's based on a series of my blog articles, particularly the one on Liferay 
7.2 and turned into a deployable plugin through Liferay's Dynamic Include 
mechanism. 

## How to build

This plugin was built in a Liferay Workspace's `modules` folder for 
Liferay DXP 7.2 

## Limitations

It's as ugly as advertised in the blog article.

Chances are that it'll no longer be necessary past Liferay CE 7.3 GA2
